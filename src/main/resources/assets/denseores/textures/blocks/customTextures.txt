Creating overrides for generated textures with texture packs.

If you are not satisfied with the generated texture for your packs, you can place overrides. First create a subfolder for the mod which owns the correct texture (which will be "minecraft" in the case of vanilla textures) and place the overrides in that folder.

If you wish to load the generated textures from Minecraft, run the command "denseores_outputtextures" ingame. This will output the textures to the folder 'denseoretextures' in your Minecraft directory. It will also put them into the correct directory structure for proper addition to a texture pack.
